# Joke App

This is a simple app that tells a joke when you press the button.

This app was the third project I completed as part of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. The project involed 
creating an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. The finished app consists
of four modules:

1. A Java library that provides jokes

2. A Google Cloud Endpoints project that serves those jokes

3. An Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes 

4. An Android app that fetches jokes from the Google Cloud Endpoints module and passes them to the Android Library for display
